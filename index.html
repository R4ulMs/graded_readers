        <span>I am a lawyer at an engineering company</span>, so I had to pay close attention to every little detail on
        all those
        papers. I also had to draft a very important contract that could improve our company's future, which filled me
        with anxiety. This document could leave no room for interpretation, so writing it was not an easy task. Every
        word needed to be chosen carefully. If I made a mistake, even a small one, the consequences could be terrible.

        I do not think anyone had lunch that day, just a huge number of cups of coffee. Eventually, people started
        ordering food. I looked at the clock on the wall: it was past 9 pm, so I ate a salad and some garlic bread at my
        desk, which helped me to keep going. Everyone was tired, but we pressed on regardless.
